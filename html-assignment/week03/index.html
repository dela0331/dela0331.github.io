            <p>
                I first came to Algonquin College in the Film and Media Production Program. I didn't really know what I wanted to do once I graduated high school, so I chose the first interesting program I found in the Algonquin pamphlet. I very much enjoyed the learning all about film and working with the equipment myslef, however I didn't like how the actual industry sounded. Everytime a teacher would talk about working on set it sounded too chaotic and long. <em>12-14 hours days back to back is standard</em> on most productions.

                I think I realised that I would much rather work from home and be able to do whatever the job is on my own time. After looking at several different programs that could possibly lead me down a career path allowing me to work from home, I landed on <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. So far I enjoy it a lot, however I am not yet sure exaclty what I'd want to do after I graduate. That will come with time, I guess.

                I was unsure what quote would fit here, so this is from a random quote generator:
